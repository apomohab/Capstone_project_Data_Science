Capstone Project Data Science

This dataset contributes to understanding the knowledge of the Specialties that contain the best courses in Udemy the location and average duration of each course and the number of lessons and helps determine the levels of students interested in these Specialties.

Strategy to solve the problem.
We are following CRISP-DM strategy

I. Business Understanding
II. Data Understanding
III. Data Preparation
IV. Modeling
V. Evaluation
VI. Deployment

Step 1: Business understand 

1. Project Objectives
2. Requirements
3. Constraints
4. Business Need
5.Purpose of Project
6. Why Automation is needed

Step 2: Data Understanding
 
1- Is there any null values in the dataset?
2- What is the shape of the dataset?
3- Which Columns Depends on each other?
4- What are the insights of the dataset?

Step 2 Part 2: Data Exploration

•	what are the level students taking the course Introduction to Web Development?
•	which are the lectures having more courses?
•	what are the top subscribed courses published in year 2017?
•	show all student level used by bar chart.
•	what are the most popular courses?
•	which are the top-rated courses
•	which courses have high prices
•	which courses have lower prices


Part 3: Data Preparation and Feature Selection

In this step we will working around data and make cleaning data and need to know some info same

1-	what is percent missing values in the variables?
2-	Assign the predicts variables and Response variable?
3-	Select the best features based on feature selection technique?

Step 4: Modeling

1-	Train test split
2-	Regression Algorithms for Price Prediction
3-	Classification Algorithms for Payment Type Prediction

Step 5: Evaluation

1-	Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R2 Score for Regression
2-	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score for Classification
 
Step 6: Deployment

1-	Selection of Best Regression Algorithm
2-	Selection of Best Classification Algorithm
3-	Oversampling to improve the accuracy
