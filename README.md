# Capstone_project_Data_Science

This data contributes to understanding the knowledge of the Specialties that contain the best
courses in udemy the location and average duration of each course and the number of lessons and 
helps determine the levels of students interested in these Specialties.


# Strategy to solve the problem.


we will select some points for work at this data used The CRISP â€” DM including this steps .

- I. Business Understanding
- II. Data Understanding
- III. Data Preparation
- IV. Modeling
- V. Evaluation
- VI. Deployment
- first step we need to check the data .




# Step 1 - 2 : Business understand & Data understand

in this step we need to get answers for some questions from data like examples

1- what is the level students take the course Introduction to Web Development ?

2- how many lectures for all courses ?

3- what is courses published in year 2017  ?

4- show all sttudent level used by barchart .





#  Step 1 - 2 Prepare Data  

 in this step we will working around data and make cleaning data 
  and need to know some info same 
  
 - **what is percent missing values in the varibles**
 - **what is varibles have more missing values** 
 - **what is frequent values in the varibles**
 - **what is the best decesion for missing values**
 - **Assign the predicts varibles and Response varibles**





# The Results

after build the model we already get this results
- The mean squared score for the model using only quantitative variables was 3362.33740942029 on 1104 values.
- The r-squared score for the model using only quantitative variables was 0.11244345082514418 on 1104 values.
